experiment on using the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster and classify the OptDigits data, originally from the UCI ML repository

This experiment is given pixel data for digits and learns to identify the digit based on its learned clusters.

Imaging of the cluster centers is generated to show what digit the cluster might be identifying as
